## Supervision

The supervision parameter outlines how much of the process can be user supervised. The example outlined shows the process being fully supervised. This ensures that the user has control of milling parameters before running, detected features and the ability to redo milling if necessary.

The process can be done fully unsupervised if required. You may also selectively supervise and unsupervise relevant stages as necessary. In the protocol tab under supervision, the supervision checkbox can be set for each stage.

## Workflows

As outlined in the walkthrough, there are two main workflows available. The standard autolamella workflow labelled as Default and the waffle method labelled as Waffle.

With the default method, the lamellae are milled in a standard fashion. The waffle method involves milling trenches in a way to allow for undercuts to be performed. Once the trenches are milled, the undercuts are performed and the lamellae are milled in the same fashion as the default method.
