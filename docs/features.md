## Supervision

The supervision parameter outlines how much of the process can be user supervised. The example outlined shows the process being fully supervised. This ensures that the user has control of milling parameters before running, detected features and the ability to redo milling if necessary.

The process can be done fully unsupervised if required. You may also selectively supervise and unsupervise relevant stages as necessary. In the protocol tab under supervision, the supervision checkbox can be set for each stage.
